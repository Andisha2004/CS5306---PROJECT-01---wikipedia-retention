# ðŸ§  Wikipedia Editor Retention Analysis

## Overview
This project studies **Wikipediaâ€™s new editors** â€” specifically, how many return after making their very first edit.  
Wikipedia relies heavily on volunteer contributors, yet most newcomers donâ€™t continue editing after their initial contribution.  
Our goal was to **quantify new-editor retention** and understand early engagement patterns.

## Data Collection
We used the **MediaWiki API** to collect edit data from **August and September 2024**.  
For each newly registered user:
- We identified their **first edit**.
- We then searched for the **next edit** that occurred afterward.

The result is a linked dataset of usersâ€™ first and second edits.

## Analysis Pipeline
We built a **Python data pipeline** to:
1. Collect and clean edit data using API calls.  
2. Join the first-edit and second-edit datasets by username.  
3. Compute monthly retention metrics:
   - Whether a user edited again within the same month.  
   - Whether they made another edit within a week.  
   - Whether they continued into the next month.

## Key Findings
- About **half of newcomers make another edit within the same week**.  
- However, **very few continue editing in later weeks or months**.  
- This suggests that while initial engagement is promising, **long-term participation remains rare**.

## Visualization
The retention bar chart highlights the drop-off pattern:
> ðŸ“Š High short-term engagement â†’ sharp decline in sustained activity.

## Next Steps
Future work could explore:
- **Topic-specific retention** â€” what kinds of pages keep users engaged?  
- **Temporal trends** â€” whether retention patterns vary across months or seasons.  
- **Interventions** â€” possible ways to improve editor onboarding and retention.
